# CSC519-SEC_Footnotes


* What are SEC Footnotes?
	-A SEC filing is a financial document submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Public companies, certain insiders, and broker-dealers are required to make regular SEC filings. Investors and financial professionals rely on these filings for information about companies they are evaluating for investment purposes.
 SEC footnotes are explanatory and supplemental notes that accompany the financial statements issued by an entity. (courtesy: *http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-are-financial-statement-footnotes.html)
